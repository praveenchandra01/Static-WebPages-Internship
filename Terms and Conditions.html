                    <p class="subhead">INTRODUCTION</p>

                    <p>This Terms of Service document ( “TOS”) sets out the conditions under which we make the SpotOn
                        Apparel Inc products on&nbsp;<a
                            href="http://www.spotonapparel.com">www.spotonapparel.com</a>&nbsp;(the “Site”) &nbsp;or on
                        the other subsidiary ventures of SpotOn Apparel. In this TOS, “we” and “us” means SpotOn Apparel
                        Inc, a Delaware limited liability company, and “you” means the user or customer. “Both of us” or
                        “Either of us” means both or either of you or SpotOn Apparel Inc. This TOS discusses important
                        limitations about the way you may use and rely upon materials you find on the Site. By using the
                        Site, you will be deemed to have accepted the contents of this TOS. If you do not accept the
                        contents of this TOS or if your right to use the Site has been terminated (see below), you may
                        not use the Site.</p>
                    <p class="subhead">LIMITATION ON USE</p>
                    <p>You are only authorized under this TOS to use the Site individually. By requesting to use, and/or
                        using the Site, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority and capacity to
                        enter into this TOS and you agree to abide by the contents of this TOS.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p class="subhead">ELIGIBILITY TO USE THE SITE</p>

                    <p>SpotOn Apparel Inc sells products for adults and youths, but we sell them to adults, who can
                        purchase with a credit card or other approved payment method. If you are under 18, you may use
                        the Site only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Any individual under the age of 18 years
                        ("Minor") must have a parent or guardian accept this TOS in order for such Minor to use the
                        Site. A parent or guardian who accepts this TOS on behalf of a Minor will be primarily liable
                        for ensuring complete and proper adherence to this TOS, including any payment obligation. A
                        parent or guardian who accepts this TOS on behalf of a Minor will continue to be primarily
                        liable for the obligations set out in this TOS even after the Minor has attained the age of 18,
                        unless the parent or guardian obtains SpotOn Apparel Inc’s express written consent to the
                        contrary. You may submit or arrange for the collated submission of orders on behalf of a group
                        of individuals (such as a team or league) (a “Group”). In such case, if you identify yourself as
                        an organizer of that Group, then you promise that you are authorized on behalf of the Group to
                        enter into this Agreement and you have authorization to obtain and provide to SpotOn Apparel Inc
                        information about the Group, solicit the Order Information (see below) from other members of the
                        Group on behalf of the Group, and that the agreements in this TOS are made by you both
                        individually and on behalf of the Group. Due to restriction on the storage and use of personal
                        information, no person under the age of 13 may use the Site. Any information relating to a
                        person under the age of 13 must be submitted by parent or guardian of such individual. You
                        hereby authorize us to verify your representations and warranties herein, and you acknowledge
                        that we reserve the right, but not the obligation, to verify such representations and
                        warranties, and to take action we deem appropriate in our sole discretion, including but not
                        limited to terminating your right to use the Site, should we determine, in our sole opinion,
                        that you have violated any representation or warranty or any other provision of this TOS.</p>

                    <p class="subhead">ORDERS PROCESS &amp; PRICING</p>

                    <p>The total price required for a purchase on the Site depends on a number of factors that may
                        change between the time you begin adding items to your cart and the time you submit your final
                        order. Products on the Site have a price associated with each product. Further, your total
                        purchase price may be affected by factors such as particular customization requests and your
                        shipping address. It is important that you properly review your complete order, including the
                        final total purchase price and the final individual item prices, before submitting your order.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your submission of an order is an offer by you to purchase the items selected at the prices
                        indicated immediately prior to your submission of the request. This offer remains open until
                        Spot On Apparel Inc emails you to confirm that it has or has not been accepted (e.g., if an item
                        has become unavailable). SpotOn Apparel Inc cannot confirm the price of an item until after your
                        order is placed.</p>
                    <p>Despite SpotOn Apparel Inc’s commercially reasonable efforts, some items may be mispriced. SpotOn
                        Apparel Inc reserves the right to cancel any orders, with no further obligations to you, even
                        after your receipt of the order confirmation mentioned above or a shipping notice. SpotOn
                        Apparel Inc may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and
                        notify you of the cancellation.</p>

                        depend on various factors, including the items purchased, customization and the shipment
                        destination.</p>
