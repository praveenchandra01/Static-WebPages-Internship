        <br />
        <h3 class="subhead"><strong>Sizing</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Our sizing charts can be found
          <a href="https://www.spotonapparel.com/sizzing-chart">Here</a>. Our
          products are made to the measurements on our sizing charts with a
          tolerance of +/-10%. We do not offer refunds or exchanges for items
          that were ordered in the wrong size. Unless you paid for a sizing kit
          or received a custom sample - you cannot base sizing off of our free
          samples we send out.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h3 class="subhead"><strong>Colors</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The colors on your uniforms and apparel is selected by using the
          Pantone color code selected in your designs or the closest Pantone
          color code based on the designs. Pantone colors are always displayed
          on your artwork. If you require any specific color codes, those must
          be provided to us. Every color will print a differently on the fabric
          after printing depending on the GSM, weight and type. For this reason,
          we do not offer refunds for color issues for shades of color. Only
          obvious mistakes in color (i.e. Navy instead of Sky Blue)&nbsp;will be
          eligible for refunds.

        <br />
        <h3 class="subhead"><strong>Designs &amp; Graphics</strong></h3>
        <p>
          The designs we make for you are a general representation of the
          uniforms and apparel that you’re going to receive. We try our best to
          match exactly what you see in our designs, but we cannot guarantee it
          100%. Things such as placement, sizes of logos and numbers, graphics,
          outlines and other design specifications must be noted in writing and
          confirmed in the design template in order for us to reproduce it
          correctly. For this reason, we do not offer refunds for design issues.
